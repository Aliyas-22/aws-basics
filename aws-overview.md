# AWS Basics Overview

## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers on-demand access to computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and more over the internet.

AWS is not a single server; it is a collection of cloud services that allow users to build and manage applications without owning physical hardware.
